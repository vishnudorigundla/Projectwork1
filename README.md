The graphic provides a concise and clear depiction of all the entities integrated into the Car Resale Value Prediction and Personalized Vehicle Recommendation system. It illustrates how various actions and decisions are interconnected, offering a visual representation of the entire process flow. The diagram outlines the functional relationships between different entities within the system. The system architecture shown is clearly demonstrates that the input is provided by the customer in the form of vehicle preferences such as brand, model, and mileage. The system retrieves historical vehicle data from the database, which is then processed through a Random Forest-based prediction model to estimate the resale value of the car. Simultaneously, the depreciation rate is calculated based on the car’s features and market trends.
